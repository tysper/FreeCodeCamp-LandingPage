As always the first day is always a journey, discovering new things, training concepts to understand them better and falling and trying again many times. New update tomorrow. No preview today, believe me there is nothing to preview hahaha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

Wow today was way better than expected, I really did put in practice all the things that I learnt, well I didn't learn, not yet, I spend all day searching and trying to apply what I wanted to do with the website, so I looked up for codes that I did, resources on MDN and StackOverFlow definetely is my favorite place now. I still did not finished but it is starting to look more like a website and less like an old word document. ðŸ˜Ž

I did some changes yesterday, and also added some parts of the page but I forgot to document it haha. Today I did some improvements on the layout and also almost finished, now the only thing missing is the footer layout that I will change tomorrow, and some minor details. I already learned so much doing some elements of the page, and I am impressed with the result, even that my UX skills aren't the best. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

I've finished everything already, now I have to make a responsive layout, and believe that will take some time because my current layout is a little to complex for me, so I think I will struggle a little. The good thing is that even if I struggle a little in this part, I thinks it is worthy, also I acquired some experiences with flex box and grid. I have a long way to go, yet I feel like I am on the right track.

Okay I finally finished this project and wow, I think this was my biggest project so far and I feel like struggling a lot, I think I will be a lot better as the time goes, but I really liked doing this project. It helped me undertand some concepts of flexbox and grid, also responsiveness, and that's all. See you in the next one!
