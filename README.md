As always the first day is always a journey, discovering new things, training concepts to understand them better and falling and trying again many times. New update tomorrow. No preview today, believe me there is nothing to preview hahaha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

Wow today was way better than expected, I really did put in practice all the things that I learnt, well I didn't learn, not yet, I spend all day searching and trying to apply what I wanted to do with the website, so I looked up for codes that I did, resources on MDN and StackOverFlow definetely is my favorite place now. I still did not finished but it is starting to look more like a website and less like an old word document. ðŸ˜Ž
